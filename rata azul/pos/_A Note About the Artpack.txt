This artpack was created over a two week period in response to new censorship on Derpibooru. This censorship revolved primarily around Aryanne, a white mare with a blonde mane, and the cutie mark on her butt. This is why the artpack prominently features her. Over these past few weeks much chaos has ensued. We've seen many reversals in policy in short periods of time, rapid changes in administration, many thousands of images places under DNP, and general mass confusion.

This artpack is the result of many artists coming together to express their freedom of speech. Anyone was allowed to participate regardless of their medium or level of skill. As such we have seen an enormous amount of support and contributions. Artists should have the right to draw what they want under creative expression and the variety of pictures for this little old horse show it.
